This library creates a pivot grid using a three step approach:

1.) A collection of data elements (tabular data) are passed to NodeBuilder. NodeBuilder groups the data and creates a hierarchical 
    node object that includes totals.

2.) The node object is passed to MatrixBuilder.  MatrixBuilder builds a matrix (grid with unbounded rows and columns).  Each cell in the matrix
	has rowspan and columnspan properties so that the matrix can be rendered as a rectangle.

3.) The matrix is passed to the UI which renders it.  Since the heavy lifting is done in steps 1 and 2 rendering the matrix is relatively simple.




Why IsRow property is necessary on Node:
GrandTotal nodes are created as columns for dimensions where IsRow is true.  The Nodes point the row dimension however they are rendered as columns so they need to use the property defined on the Node object.

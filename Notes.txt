This library creates a pivot grid using a three step approach:

1.) A collection of data elements (tabular data) are passed to NodeBuilder. NodeBuilder groups the data and creates a hierarchical 
    node object that includes totals.

2.) The node object is passed to MatrixBuilder.  MatrixBuilder builds a matrix (grid with unbounded rows and columns).  Each cell in the matrix
	has rowspan and columnspan properties so that the matrix can be rendered as a rectangle.

3.) The matrix is passed to the UI which renders it.  Since the heavy lifting is done in steps 1 and 2 rendering the matrix is relatively simple.
